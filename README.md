#EXPLORING THE IMPACT OF MILITARY SPENDING ON ECONOMIC OUTPUT: A DATA EXPLORATION

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to investigate the relationship between military spending and economic output in the United States. The aim is to analyze existing data to determine whether military expenditure contributes to an increase or decrease in economic output. By conducting this analysis, we seek to provide insights into the potential economic ramifications of military spending policies

Hypothesis Statement:
Based on contrasting claims from prominent organizations, we hypothesize that the relationship between military spending and economic output is multifaceted. The War Prevention Initiative posits that military spending decreases a nation's economic output, suggesting that resources allocated to defense detract from productive investment. Conversely, the Rand Corporation argues that military spending stimulates economic growth, suggesting that investments in defense infrastructure and technology foster innovation and productivity gains.

Expert Narratives:
According to RAND research report, “The applied macroeconomics literature consistently finds that defense spending has a positive effect on growth (2024)”.  

According to a War Prevention Initiative meta-analysis, “Over a 20-year period, a 1% increase in military spending will decrease a country’s economic growth by 9% (2017)”.
